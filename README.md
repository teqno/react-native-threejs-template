# react-native-threejs-template

Basic setup of the react-native + three.js + typescript project

## Why it exists?

I haven't found any decent guides on how to setup a react native + three.js + typescript project, so here it is.

## Why this setup?

- Typescript
- Example of absolute file import
- Dependencies are specified with particular versions to avoid potential external breaking changes (it just works)

## Other features

- Examples of
  - I/O interaction with react native elements
  - texture usage
  - object animation

## TODO

Create good starter project that demonstrates how to make a simple game with three.js
